          Common questions about fraud prevention‚Äîclear, practical answers your
          family can act on today.
        </p>

        <div className="faq-content">
          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>1) How do I know if a support call is fake?</h2>
            <p>
              Short answer: If they called you, assume it‚Äôs fake.
              <br />
              Do this: Hang up ‚Üí open the brand‚Äôs official app/website or call
              the number on your card/bill ‚Üí you call them.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>2) Should I ever share an OTP, PIN, or password on a call?</h2>
            <p>
              Never. No bank, tech company, or government agency needs your
              OTP/PIN/password on the phone or via text.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>3) My bank called about ‚Äúfraud.‚Äù What do I do?</h2>
            <p>
              Hang up ‚Üí call the number on the back of your card ‚Üí ask for the
              fraud department ‚Üí review recent charges & enable alerts.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>
              4) I clicked a suspicious link and typed my password‚Äîam I hacked?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Maybe. <br />
              Do this now:
              <br />1. Change that password everywhere you used it.
              <br />2. Turn on 2-step verification.
              <br />3. Run a security scan on your device.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>5) I sent money by Zelle/wire‚Äîcan I get it back?</h2>
            <p>
              Often hard. Call your bank immediately and request a recall/fraud
              hold. File a report (IC3/FTC). Speed matters.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>6) I paid with gift cards or crypto‚Äîam I stuck?</h2>
            <p>
              Usually, yes. Contact the gift-card issuer or exchange
              immediately; report to IC3/FTC. Next time: use credit cards only.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>7) Amazon/PayPal emailed a big ‚Äúorder confirmation.‚Äù Real or fake?</h2>
            <p>
              Check inside the official app (Amazon ‚Üí Orders, PayPal ‚Üí
              Activity). If it‚Äôs not there, the email is a phish.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>8) A pop-up says ‚ÄúVirus detected‚Äîcall Microsoft.‚Äù</h2>
            <p>
              It‚Äôs a scam. Close the tab/app (use Task Manager/Force Quit), run
              your antivirus, and only seek help via official channels.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>9) What‚Äôs the safest way to handle passwords?</h2>
            <p>
              Use a password manager. One strong master passphrase (4‚Äì5 random
              words). Unique 16+ chars for every site. Turn on 2FA.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>10) Credit card or debit card for online purchases?</h2>
            <p>
              Credit card. Better fraud protections and chargebacks. Avoid bank
              transfers, gift cards, and crypto for strangers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>11) How do I protect my phone number from SIM-swap scams?</h2>
            <p>
              Set a SIM PIN, add a carrier account PIN, and request a port
              freeze/lock from your carrier.
            </p>

            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>13) Are QR codes safe?</h2>
            <p>
              Treat unknown QR codes like links from strangers. When in doubt,
              type the website instead of scanning.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="faq-block">
            <h2>14) What are the red flags for investment/crypto scams?</h2>

              They ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù pay too much, ask you to return the
              difference; their check bounces later. Never send money back on
              unexpected checks.
